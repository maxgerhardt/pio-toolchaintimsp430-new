        <td>G++ does not handle thunks in functions with varargs</td>
        <td>Thunk functions, used to implement C++ virtual function calls with multiple inheritance,
          that are variadic and so take a variable number of arguments,
          are unsupported.
          <br>The compiler will emit an error message when trying to use these:
          <br><samp>error: generic thunk code fails for method 'METHOD' which uses '...'</samp> </td>

        <td><var>atexit</var>-registered functions don't run at program termination</td>
        <td>After returning from main, MSP430-GCC applications will not perform any termination steps, such as calling
          functions registered with <var>atexit()</var>.</td>
        <td>Override the default, weak definition of <code>void _exit (int status)</code> with one that will call the <var>atexit</var>-registered termination functions.
          <var>__call_exitprocs</var> from <var>libc</var> performs the required operations.
          <br>
          A example implementation is below:
          <br>
          <code><pre>
extern void __call_exitprocs (int status, void *ptr);

void _exit (int status)
{
  __call_exitprocs (status, NULL);
  while (1);
}
          </pre></code>
          Ensure this code is wrapped in <code>extern "C" {}</code> if defined in a C++ program.</td>

        <td>The low-level I/O functions <var>open</var>, <var>close</var>, <var>read</var>, <var>lseek</var> and <var>rename</var> are implemented only as stub functions in the MSP430-GCC libraries.
          <br>If they are used, errno will be set to ENOSYS, and the function will return -1.
          <br>Only <var>unlink</var> and <var>write</var> are implemented in a TI C I/O compatible manner.

          MSP430 Optimizing C/C++ Compiler User Guide</var> (slau132) as a reference. The functions are defined with weak binding in the libraries, so
          a definition in the application will override them.</td>

          required for full <var>__cxa_atexit</var>-compliant support of C++ destructors.
          These are unused by MSP430-GCC applications and unnecessarily increase the size requirements of the application.</td>

        <td>Output sections are not grouped by their LMA/VMA regions in the MSP430 device linker scripts.
          <br>This results in excess ELF segments being used to construct the program image, which can negatively affect load times.
          <td>Make the following changes to the output section ordering in the linker script:
            <ul>
              <li>Primarily group sections with LMA != VMA, which have matching LMA and VMA regions.</li>
              <li>Secondarily group sections by either VMA or LMA region. VMA region is preferable when considering the execution view of the program.</li>

        <td>The contents of the <var>.upper.data</var> section of executable files that are linked using linker scripts for MSP430
          FRAM devices, will be unnecessarily copied from a load address to a virtual address during program
          initialization. This is because a separate load region is specified for the <var>.upper.data</var> output section.
          <br>The load region is set as FRAM, however the data can be loaded directly
          to the HIFRAM region, avoiding the need for run-time initialization of the data in the section.
        </td>
        <td>Apply the patch described in the workaround field of the entry for this issue in the TI Bug and Enhancement System to the linker script.
          The patch removes the separate load region, and the symbols that indicate data must be
          copied by the C-Runtime startup code. This produces the following new definition for <var>.upper.data</var>:
          <pre><code>  .upper.data :
  {
    __high_datastart = .;
    *(.upper.data.* .upper.data)
    __high_dataend = .;
